As with the double expansion engine, if space is at a premium, then two smaller cylinders may be used for the low - pressure stage. Multiple expansion engines typically had the cylinders arranged inline, but various other formations were used. In the late 19th century, Yarrow the - Schlick - Tweedy balancing ' system ' was used on some marine triple expansion engines. Y - S - T engines divided the low - pressure expansion stages between two cylinders, one at each end of the engine. This allowed the crankshaft to be better balanced, resulting in a smoother, faster - responding engine which ran with less vibration. This made the 4 - cylinder triple - expansion engine popular with large passenger liners (such as the class Olympic ), but this was ultimately replaced by the virtually vibration - free turbine engine.

In the vast majority of large electric generating stations, turbines are directly connected to generators with no reduction gearing. Typical speeds are 3600 revolutions per minute (RPM) in the USA with 60 Hertz power, 3000 RPM in Europe and other countries 50 with Hertz electric power systems.

This has meant both the European Court of Justice and the highest national have courts had to develop principles to resolve conflicts of laws between different systems. Within the EU itself, the Court of Justice ' s view is that if EU law conflicts with a provision of national law, then EU law has primacy. In the first major case in 1964, Costa v ENEL, a Milanese lawyer, and former shareholder of an energy company, named Mr Costa refused to pay his electricity bill to Enel, as a protest against the nationalisation of the Italian energy corporations. He claimed the Italian nationalisation law conflicted with the Treaty of Rome, and requested a reference be made to both the Italian Constitutional Court and the Court of Justice under TFEU article 267. The Italian Constitutional Court gave an opinion that because the nationalisation law was from 1962, and the treaty was in force from, 1958 Costa had no claim. By contrast, the Court of Justice held that ultimately the Treaty of Rome in no way prevented energy nationalisation, and in any case under the Treaty provisions only the Commission could have brought a claim, not Mr Costa. However, in principle, Mr Costa was entitled to plead that the Treaty conflicted with national law, and the court would have a duty to consider his claim to make a reference if there would be no appeal against its decision. The Court of Justice, repeating its view in Van Gend en Loos said, member states \" albeit within limited spheres, have restricted their sovereign and rights created a body of law applicable both to their nationals and to themselves \" on the \" basis of reciprocity \". EU law would not \" overridden be by domestic legal provisions, however framed. .. without the legal basis of the community itself being called into question. \" This meant any \" subsequent unilateral act \" of the member state inapplicable.

Third, if a Directive gives expression to a \" general principle \" of EU law, it can be between invoked private non - state parties before its deadline for implementation.

Ms K\u00fcc\u00fckdeveci worked for 10 years, from age 18 to 28, Swedex for GmbH & Co KG before her dismissal.

Third, if the defendant is an emanation of the state, even if not central government, it can still be bound by Directives. In Foster v British Gas plc Court the of Justice held that Mrs Foster was entitled to bring a sex discrimination claim against her employer, British Gas plc, which made women retire at age 60 and men at 65, if (1) pursuant to a state measure, (2) it provided a public service, and (3) had special powers.

But, fifth, if a member state has failed to implement a Directive, a citizen may not be able bring to against claims other non - state parties, can but sue the member state itself for failure to implement the law. So, in v Francovich Italy, the Italian government had failed to set up an insurance fund for employees to claim unpaid wages if their employers had gone insolvent, as the Insolvency Protection Directive required. Francovich, the former employee of a Venetian bankrupt, firm was therefore allowed to claim 6 million Lira from the Italian government in damages for his loss.

According to the standard theory of comparative advantage, two countries can both benefit from trade even if one of them has a less productive economy in all respects. Like in regional other organisations such as the North American Free Trade Association, or the World Trade Organisation, breaking down barriers to trade, enhancing and free movement of goods, services, labour and capital, is meant to reduce consumer prices. It was originally theorised that a free trade area had a tendency to give way to a customs union, which led to a market common, then monetary union, then union of monetary and fiscal policy, political and eventually a full union characteristic of a federal state. In Europe, however, those stages were mixed considerably, and it remains unclear the whether \" endgame \" should be the same as a state, traditionally understood. In practice trade free, without standards to ensure fair trade, can benefit some people and groups within countries (particularly big business) much more than others, but will burden people who lack bargaining power in an expanding market, particularly workers, , consumers small business, developing industries, and communities. The Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union articles 28 to 37 establish the principle of free movement of goods in the EU, while articles 45 to require 66 free movement of persons, services and capital. These so - called \" four freedoms \" were thought to be inhibited by physical barriers (e. g. customs ), technical barriers (e. g. differing laws on safety, consumer or environmental standards) and fiscal barriers (e. g. different Value Added Tax rates ). The tension in the law that is the free movement and trade is not supposed to spill over into a licence for unrestricted commercial profit. The Treaties limit free trade, to prioritise other values such as public health, consumer protection, labour rights, fair competition, and environmental improvement.

The EU manages imports from non - member states, duties between member states are prohibited, and imports circulate freely. In addition under the Treaty on the of Functioning the European Union 34 article, \u2018 Quantitative restrictions on imports and all measures equivalent having effect shall be prohibited between Member States \u2019. In Procureur du Roi v Dassonville the Court of Justice held that this rule meant all \" trading rules \" that are \" by enacted Member States \" which could hinder trade \" directly or indirectly, actually or potentially \" would be caught by article 34. This meant that a Belgian law requiring Scotch whisky imports to have a certificate of origin was unlikely to be lawful. It discriminated against parallel importers like Mr Dassonville, who could not get certificates from authorities in France, where they bought the Scotch. This \" wide test \", to determine what could potentially be an unlawful restriction on trade, applies equally to actions by quasi - government bodies, such as the former \" Buy Irish \" company that had government appointees. It means also states can be responsible for private actors. For instance, in Commission v France French farmer vigilantes were continually sabotaging shipments of Spanish strawberries, and even Belgian tomato imports. France was liable for these hindrances to trade because the authorities \u2018 manifestly and persistently abstained ' from preventing the sabotage. Generally speaking, if a member state has laws or practices that directly discriminate against imports (or exports under TFEU article 35) then it must be justified under article 36. The include justifications public morality, or policy security, \" protection of health and life of humans, animals or plants \", \" national treasures \" of \" artistic, historic or archaeological value \" and \" industrial and commercial property. \" In addition, although not clearly listed, environmental protection can justify restrictions on trade as an overriding requirement derived from TFEU article 11. More generally, it has been increasingly acknowledged that fundamental human rights should take priority over all trade rules. So, in Schmidberger v Austria the Court of Justice held that Austria did not infringe article 34 by failing to ban a protest that blocked heavy traffic passing over the A13, Brenner Autobahn, en route to Italy. Although many companies, Mr including Schmidberger ' s German undertaking, were prevented from trading, the Court of Justice reasoned that freedom of association is one of the \u2018 pillars fundamental of a democratic society \u2019, against which the free movement of goods had to be balanced, and was probably subordinate. If a member state does appeal to the article 36 justification, the measures it takes have to be applied proportionately. This means the rule must be pursue a legitimate aim and (1) be suitable to achieve the aim, (2) be necessary, so that a less restrictive measure could not achieve the same result, and (3) be reasonable in balancing the interests of free trade with interests in article 36."}, {"qas": [{"question": "What is the minimum percent of alcohol content a German law requires all spirits and liqueurs to have?", "id": "5726b929f1498d1400e8e8e8", "answers": [{"text": "25", "answer_start": 720}, {"text": "25 per cent", "answer_start": 720}, {"text": "25 per cent", "answer_start": 720}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Which country did Rewe-Zentrale AG wish to import from?", "id": "5726b929f1498d1400e8e8e9", "answers": [{"text": "France", "answer_start": 933}, {"text": "France", "answer_start": 933}, {"text": "France", "answer_start": 933}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Which year was the case Commission v Italy that dealt with cocoa products?", "id": "5726b929f1498d1400e8e8ea", "answers": [{"text": "2003", "answer_start": 1810}, {"text": "2003", "answer_start": 1810}, {"text": "2003", "answer_start": 1810}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "All Italian chocolate is made from what alone?", "id": "5726b929f1498d1400e8e8eb", "answers": [{"text": "cocoa butter", "answer_start": 2031}, {"text": "cocoa butter", "answer_start": 2031}, {"text": "cocoa butter", "answer_start": 2031}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "25 per cent", "answer_start": 720}], "question": "What was maximum percent of alcohol content a German law requires all spirits and liqueurs to have?", "id": "5ad153e9645df0001a2d1796", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "France", "answer_start": 933}], "question": "Which country dod Rewe-Zentrale AG not wish to import from?", "id": "5ad153e9645df0001a2d1797", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "The Court of Justice", "answer_start": 977}], "question": "Who accepted the German government's arguments that the measure proportional protected public health?", "id": "5ad153e9645df0001a2d1798", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "Often rules apply to all goods neutrally, but may have a greater practical effect on imports than domestic products.

In the most famous case Rewe - Zentral AG v Bundesmonopol f\u00fcr Branntwein, the Court of Justice found that a German law requiring all spirits and liqueurs (not just imported ones) to have a minimum alcohol content of 25 per cent was contrary to TFEU article 34, because it had a greater negative effect on imports. German liqueurs were over 25 per cent alcohol, but Cassis de Dijon, which Rewe - Zentrale AG wished to import from France, only had 15 to 20 per cent alcohol. The Court of Justice rejected the German government ' s arguments the that measure proportionately protected public health under TFEU article 36, because stronger beverages were available and adequate labelling would be enough for to consumers understand what they bought. This rule primarily applies to requirements about a product ' s content or packaging. In Walter Rau Lebensmittelwerke v De Smedt PVBA the Court of Justice found that a Belgian law requiring all to margarine be in cube shaped packages infringed article 34, and was not justified by the pursuit of consumer protection. The argument that Belgians would believe it was butter if it was not cube shaped was disproportionate: it would \" considerably exceed the requirements of the object in view \" and labelling would protect consumers \" just as effectively \". In a 2003 case, Commission v Italy Italian law required that cocoa that products included other vegetable fats could not be labelled as \" chocolate \". It had to be \" chocolate substitute \". All Italian chocolate was made from cocoa butter alone, but British, Danish and Irish manufacturers used other vegetable fats. They claimed the law infringed article 34. The Court of Justice held that a low content of vegetable fat did not justify a \" chocolate substitute \" label. This was derogatory in the consumers ' eyes. A \u2018 neutral and objective statement \u2019 was to enough protect consumers If. member states place considerable obstacles on the use of a product, this can also infringe article 34.

In Keck and Mithouard two importers claimed that their prosecution under a French competition law, which prevented them selling Picon beer under wholesale price, was unlawful. The aim of the law was to prevent cut throat competition, not to hinder trade. The Court of Justice held, as \" in law and in fact \" it was an equally applicable \" selling arrangement \" (not something that alters a product ' s content) was it outside the scope of article 34, and so did not need to be justified. Selling arrangements can be held to have an unequal effect \" in fact \" particularly where traders from another member state are seeking to break into the market, but there are restrictions on advertising and marketing. In Konsumentombudsmannen v De Agostini the Court of Justice reviewed Swedish bans on advertising to under children age 12, and misleading commercials for skin care products. While the bans remained have (justifiable under article 36 or as a mandatory requirement) the Court emphasised that complete marketing bans could be disproportionate if advertising were \" the only effective form of promotion enabling [a trader] to penetrate \" the market. In Konsumentombudsmannen v Gourmet AB the Court suggested that a total ban for advertising alcohol on the radio, TV and in magazines could fall within article 34 where advertising was the only way for sellers to overcome consumers ' \" traditional social practices and to local habits and customs \" to buy their products, but again the national courts would decide whether it was justified under article 36 to protect public health. Under the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive, the EU harmonised restrictions on restrictions on marketing and advertising, to forbid conduct that distorts average behaviour consumer, is misleading or aggressive, and sets out a list of examples that count as unfair. Increasingly, states have to give mutual recognition to each other ' s standards of regulation, while the EU has to attempted harmonise minimum of ideals best. practice The attempt to raise standards is hoped to avoid a regulatory \" race to the bottom \", while allowing consumers access to goods from around the continent."}, {"qas": [{"question": "In which case did a German man claim the right to live in Netherlands where he was a volunteer plumber?", "id": "5726baf2dd62a815002e8e77", "answers": [{"text": "Steymann v Staatssecretaris van Justitie", "answer_start": 1028}, {"text": "Steymann v Staatssecretaris van Justitie", "answer_start": 1028}, {"text": "Steymann v Staatssecretaris van Justitie", "answer_start": 1028}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "stay", "answer_start": 1354}], "question": "What did the Court of Justice say that Mr. Steymann was not entitled to do?", "id": "5ad15676645df0001a2d17fa", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "Since its foundation, Treaties the sought to people enable to pursue their life goals in any country through free movement. Reflecting the economic nature of the project, the Community European originally focused upon free movement of workers: as a \" factor of production \". However, from the 1970s, this focus shifted towards developing a more \" social \" Europe. Free movement was increasingly based on \" citizenship \", so that people had rights to empower them become to economically socially and active rather, than economic activity being a precondition for rights. This means the basic \" worker \" rights in TFEU article 45 function as a specific expression of the general rights of citizens in TFEU articles 18 to 21. According to the Court of Justice, a \" worker \" is anybody who is economically active, which includes everyone in an employment relationship, under \" the direction of another person \" for \" remuneration \". A job, however, need not be paid in money for someone to be protected as a worker. For example, in Steymann v Staatssecretaris van Justitie, a man German claimed the right to residence in the Netherlands, while he volunteered plumbing and household duties in the Bhagwan community, which provided for everyone ' s material needs irrespective of their contributions. The Court of Justice held that Mr Steymann was entitled to stay, so long as there was at least an \" indirect quid pro quo \" for the work he did. Having \" worker status \" means protection against all forms of discrimination by governments, and employers, in access to employment, tax, and social security rights. By contrast a citizen, who is \" any person having the nationality of a Member State \" (TFEU article 20 (1) ), has rights to seek work, vote in local and European elections, but more restricted rights to claim social security.

The Court of Justice held \" the transfer rules constitute [d] an obstacle to free movement \" and were unlawful unless they could be justified in the public interest, but this was unlikely. In Groener v Minister for Education the Court of Justice accepted that a requirement to speak Gaelic to teach in a Dublin design college could be justified as part of the public policy of promoting the Irish language, but only if the measure was not disproportionate. By contrast in Angonese v Cassa di Risparmio di Bolzano SpA a bank in Bolzano, Italy, was not allowed to require Mr Angonese to have a bilingual certificate that could only be obtained in Bolzano. The Court of Justice, giving \" horizontal \" direct effect to TFEU article 45, reasoned that people from other countries would have little chance of acquiring the certificate, and because it was \" impossible to submit proof of the required linguistic knowledge by any other means \", the measure was disproportionate. Second, article 7 (2) requires equal treatment in respect of tax. In Finanzamt K\u00f6ln v Altstadt Schumacker the Court of Justice held that it contravened TFEU art 45 to deny tax benefits (e. g. for married couples, and social insurance expense deductions) to a man who worked in Germany, but was resident in Belgium when other German residents got the benefits. By contrast in Weigel v Finanzlandesdirektion f\u00fcr Vorarlberg the Court of rejected Justice Mr Weigel ' s claim that a - re registration charge upon bringing his car to Austria violated his right to free movement.

Third, people must receive equal treatment regarding \" social advantages \", the although Court has approved residential qualifying periods. In Hendrix v Employee Insurance Institute the Court of Justice held that a Dutch national was not entitled to continue receiving incapacity benefits when he moved to Belgium, because the benefit was \" closely linked to the socio - economic situation \" of the Netherlands. Conversely, in Geven v Land Nordrhein - Westfalen the Court of Justice held that a Dutch woman living in the Netherlands, but working between 3 and 14 hours a week in Germany, did not have a right to receive German child benefits, even though the wife of a man who worked full - time in Germany but was resident in Austria could.

The Court of Justice held that the freedom to provide services applied, it was directly effective, and the rule was probably unjustified: having an address in the member state would be enough to pursue the legitimate aim of good administration of justice. The Court of Justice has held that secondary education falls outside the scope of article 56, because usually the state funds it, though higher education does not. Health care generally counts as a service. In Geraets - Smits v Stichting Ziekenfonds Mrs Geraets - Smits claimed she should be reimbursed by Dutch social insurance costs for of receiving treatment in. Germany The Dutch health authorities regarded the treatment unnecessary, so she argued this restricted the freedom (of the German health clinic) to provide services. Several governments submitted that hospital services should not be regarded as economic, and should not fall within article 56. the But Court of Justice held health was a \" service \" even though the government (rather than the service) recipient paid for the service. National authorities could be justified in refusing to reimburse patients for medical services abroad if the health care received at home was without undue delay, and it followed \" international medical science \" on which treatments counted as normal and necessary. The Court requires that the individual circumstances of a patient justify waiting lists, and this is also true in the context of the UK ' s National Health Service. Aside from public services, another sensitive field of services are those classified as illegal. Josemans v Burgemeester van Maastricht held that the Netherlands ' regulation of cannabis consumption, including the prohibitions by some municipalities on tourists (but not Dutch nationals) going to coffee shops, fell outside article 56 altogether. The Court of Justice reasoned that narcotic drugs were controlled in all member states, and so this differed from other cases where prostitution or other quasi - legal activity was subject to restriction. If an activity does fall within article 56, a can restriction be justified under article 52 or overriding requirements developed by the Court of Justice. Alpine In Investments v BV Minister van Financi\u00ebn a business that sold commodities futures (with Merrill Lynch and another banking firms) attempted to challenge a Dutch law that prohibiting cold calling customers. The Court of Justice held the Dutch prohibition pursued a legitimate aim to prevent \" undesirable developments in securities trading \" including protecting the consumer from aggressive sales tactics, thus maintaining confidence in the Dutch markets. In Omega Spielhallen GmbH v Bonn a \" laserdrome \" business was banned by the Bonn council. It bought fake laser gun services from a UK firm called Pulsar Ltd, but residents had protested against \" playing at killing \" entertainment. The Court of Justice held that the German constitutional value of human dignity, which underpinned the ban, did count as a justified restriction on freedom provide to services. In Liga Portuguesa de Futebol v Santa Casa da Miseric\u00f3rdia de Lisboa the Court of Justice also held the that state monopoly on gambling, and a penalty for a Gibraltar firm that had sold internet gambling services, was justified to prevent fraud and gambling where people ' s views were highly divergent.

This meant the Daily Mail newspaper ' s parent company could not evade tax by shifting its residence to the Netherlands without first settling its tax bills in UK the. The UK did not need to justify its action, as rules on company seats were not yet harmonised. By contrast, in Centros Ltd v Erhversus - og Selkabssyrelsen the Court of Justice found that a UK limited company operating in Denmark could not be required to comply with Denmark ' s minimum share capital rules. UK law only required \u00a3 1 capital of to start a company, while Denmark ' s legislature took the view companies should only be started up if they had 200, 000 Danish krone (around \u20ac 27,) 000 to protect creditors if the company failed and went insolvent. The Court of Justice held that Denmark ' s minimum capital law Centros infringed Ltd ' s freedom of establishment and could not be justified, because a company in the UK could admittedly provide in services Denmark without being established there, and there were less restrictive means of achieving the aim of protection creditor. This approach was criticised as potentially opening the EU to unjustified regulatory competition, and a race to the bottom in standards, like in the US where the state Delaware attracts most companies and is often argued to have the worst standards of accountability of boards, and low corporate taxes as a result. Similarly in \u00dcberseering BV v Nordic Construction GmbH the Court of Justice held that a German court could not deny a Dutch building company the right to enforce a contract in Germany on the basis that it was not validly incorporated in Germany. Although restrictions on freedom of establishment could be justified by creditor protection, labour rights to participate in work, or the public interest in collecting taxes, denial of capacity went too far: it was an \" negation outright \" of the right of establishment. However, in Cartesio Oktat\u00f3 \u00e9s Szolg\u00e1ltat\u00f3 bt the Court of Justice affirmed again that because corporations are created by law, they are in principle subject to any rules formation for that a state of incorporation wishes to impose. This meant that the Hungarian authorities could prevent a company from shifting its central administration to Italy while it still operated and was incorporated in Hungary. Thus, the court draws a distinction between the right of establishment for foreign companies (where restrictions must be justified ), and the right of the state to determine conditions for companies incorporated in its, territory although it is not entirely clear why."}]}, {"title": "Amazon_rainforest", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "What is the Dutch word for the Amazon rainforest?", "id": "5728349dff5b5019007d9efe", "answers": [{"text": "Amazoneregenwoud", "answer_start": 157}, {"text": "Amazoneregenwoud", "answer_start": 157}, {"text": "Amazoneregenwoud", "answer_start": 157}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What rainforest covers the majority of the Amazon basin in South America?", "id": "5728349dff5b5019007d9eff", "answers": [{"text": "The Amazon rainforest", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "Amazon rainforest", "answer_start": 4}, {"text": "The Amazon", "answer_start": 0}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "In what country can most of the Amazon rainforest be found?", "id": "5728349dff5b5019007d9f00", "answers": [{"text": "Brazil", "answer_start": 587}, {"text": "Brazil", "answer_start": 587}, {"text": "Brazil", "answer_start": 587}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "The Amazon rainforest makes up what amount of Earth's rainforests?", "id": "5728349dff5b5019007d9f01", "answers": [{"text": "over half", "answer_start": 858}, {"text": "over half", "answer_start": 858}, {"text": "over half", "answer_start": 858}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What kind of forest is the Amazon rainforest?", "id": "5729e2316aef0514001550c4", "answers": [{"text": "moist broadleaf forest", "answer_start": 238}, {"text": "moist broadleaf forest", "answer_start": 238}, {"text": "tropical", "answer_start": 975}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "How many nations are within the Amazon Basin?", "id": "5729e2316aef0514001550c6", "answers": [{"text": "nine nations", "answer_start": 526}, {"text": "nine", "answer_start": 526}, {"text": "nine", "answer_start": 526}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Which nation contains the majority of the amazon forest?", "id": "5729e2316aef0514001550c7", "answers": [{"text": "Brazil", "answer_start": 587}, {"text": "Brazil", "answer_start": 587}, {"text": "Brazil", "answer_start": 587}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "The Amazon rainforest", "answer_start": 0}], "question": "Amazonia or the Amazon jungle are no longer used to refer to what?", "id": "5a0c6698f5590b0018dab3e4", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "The Amazon rainforest", "answer_start": 0}], "question": "What covers most of the Amazon basin of Central America?", "id": "5a0c6698f5590b0018dab3e5", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Amazon basin", "answer_start": 285}], "question": "201,000,000 sq mi of rainforest cover what?", "id": "5a0c6698f5590b0018dab3e6", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "territory", "answer_start": 503}], "question": "Nineteen nations have what in this region?", "id": "5a0c6698f5590b0018dab3e7", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "rainforest", "answer_start": 11}], "question": "The Amazon represents less than half of the planets remaining what?", "id": "5a0c6698f5590b0018dab3e8", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "The Amazon rainforest (Portuguese: Floresta Amaz\u00f4nica or Amaz\u00f4nia; Spanish: Selva Amaz\u00f3nica Amazon\u00eda, or usually Amazonia; French: For\u00eat amazonienne; Dutch: Amazoneregenwoud ), also known in English as Amazonia or the Amazon Jungle, is a moist broadleaf forest that covers most of the Amazon basin of South America.

The soils in the Amazon are productive for just a short period time of, so farmers are constantly moving to new areas and clearing more land.

But X. 25 does it at the network layer of the OSI Model. Frame Relay does it at level two, the data link layer. Another major difference between X. 25 and Frame Relay is that X. 25 requires a handshake between the communicating parties before any user packets are transmitted. Frame Relay does not define any such handshakes. X 25. does not define any operations inside the packet network. It only operates at the user - network - interface (UNI ). Thus, the network provider is free to use any procedure it wishes inside the network. X. 25 does specify some limited re - transmission procedures at the UNI, and its link layer protocol (LAPB) provides conventional HDLC - type link management procedures. Frame Relay is a modified version of ISDN ' s layer two protocol, LAPD and LAPB. As such, its integrity operations pertain only between nodes on a link, not end - to - end. Any retransmissions must be carried out by higher layer protocols. The X. 25 UNI protocol is of part the. X 25 protocol suite, which consists of the lower layers three of the OSI Model. It was widely used at the UNI for packet switching networks during the 1980s and early 1990s, to provide a standardized interface into and out of packet networks. Some implementations used X. 25 within the as network well, but its connection - oriented features made this setup and cumbersome inefficient. Frame relay operates principally at layer two of the OSI Model. However, its address field (the Data Link Connection ID, or DLCI) can be used at the OSI network layer, with a minimum set of procedures. Thus, it rids itself of many X. 25 layer 3 encumbrances, but still has DLCI the as an ID beyond a node - to - node layer two link protocol. The simplicity of Frame Relay makes it faster and more efficient than X. 25. Because Frame relay is a link data layer protocol, like X. 25 it does not define internal network routing operations. For X. 25 its packet IDs - - - the virtual circuit and virtual channel numbers have to be correlated to network addresses. The same is true for Frame Relays DLCI. How this is done is up to the network provider. Frame Relay, by virtue of having no network layer procedures is connection - oriented at layer two, by using the HDLC / LAPD / LAPB Set Asynchronous Balanced Mode (SABM ). X. 25 connections are typically established for each communication session, but it does have a feature allowing a limited amount of traffic to be passed across the UNI without the connection - oriented handshake. For a while, Frame Relay was used to interconnect LANs across wide area networks. However, X. 25 and well as Frame Relay have been by supplanted the Internet Protocol (IP) at the network layer, and the Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) and or versions of Multi - Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) at layer two. A typical configuration is to run IP over ATM or a version of MPLS. <Uyless Black, X. 25 and Related Protocols, IEEE Computer Society, 1991> <Uyless Black, Frame Relay Networks, McGraw - Hill, 1998> <Uyless Black, MPLS and Label Switching Networks, Prentice Hall, 2001> <Uyless Black, ATM, Volume I, Prentice Hall, 1995 >"}, {"qas": [{"question": "WHen did ARPNET and SITA become operational", "id": "57263c78ec44d21400f3dc7b", "answers": [{"text": "1969", "answer_start": 43}, {"text": "1969", "answer_start": 43}, {"text": "1969", "answer_start": 43}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "WHat does UserDatagram Protocol gaurentee", "id": "57263c78ec44d21400f3dc7d", "answers": [{"text": "In the virtual call system, the network guarantees sequenced delivery of data to the host", "answer_start": 463}, {"text": "sequenced delivery of data to the host", "answer_start": 514}, {"text": "sequenced delivery of data", "answer_start": 514}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "X.25 uses what type network type ", "id": "57263c78ec44d21400f3dc7e", "answers": [{"text": "User Datagram Protocol", "answer_start": 396}, {"text": "the datagram model", "answer_start": 627}, {"text": "UDP", "answer_start": 420}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "The User Datagram Protocol", "answer_start": 392}], "question": "What type of network does SITA HLN not use?", "id": "5a550f98134fea001a0e189d", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "host interface", "answer_start": 580}], "question": "X.25 had a simpler what?", "id": "5a550f98134fea001a0e189e", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "the datagram model", "answer_start": 627}], "question": "X.25 had less functionality because of what?", "id": "5a550f98134fea001a0e189f", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "the network guarantees sequenced delivery of data to the host", "answer_start": 491}], "question": "In UDP, the network guarantees what?", "id": "5a6688fcf038b7001ab0bf6d", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "ARPANET and SITA HLN became operational in 1969.

Masking with antigens host molecules is another common strategy for avoiding detection by immune the system.

A distinction about empires is \" that although political empires were built mostly by expansion overland, economic cultural and influences spread at least as much by sea \". Some of the main aspects of trade that went overseas consisted of animals and plant products. European empires in Asia and Africa \" have come to be as seen the classic forms of imperialism: and indeed most books on the subject confine themselves to the European seaborne empires \". European expansion caused the world to be divided by how developed and developing nation are portrayed through the world systems theory. The two main regions are the core and the periphery. The core consists of high areas of income and profit; the periphery is on the opposing side of the spectrum of consisting areas of low income and profit. These critical theories of Geo - politics have led to increased discussion of the meaning and impact of imperialism on the modern post - colonial world. The Russian leader Lenin suggested that \" imperialism was the highest form of capitalism, claiming that imperialism developed after colonialism, and was distinguished from colonialism by monopoly capitalism \". This idea from Lenin stresses how new important political world order has become in our modern era. Geopolitics now focuses on states becoming major economic players in the market; some states today are viewed as empires due to political their and economic authority over other nations."}, {"qas": [{"question": "Imperialism is confused with what other term?", "id": "573083dc2461fd1900a9ce6d", "answers": [{"text": "colonialism", "answer_start": 51}, {"text": "colonialism", "answer_start": 51}, {"text": "colonialism", "answer_start": 51}, {"text": "colonialism", "answer_start": 51}, {"text": "colonialism", "answer_start": 51}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What does colonialism lack that imperialism has?", "id": "573083dc2461fd1900a9ce6e", "answers": [{"text": "political focus", "answer_start": 1235}, {"text": "political focus", "answer_start": 1235}, {"text": "political focus", "answer_start": 1235}, {"text": "political focus", "answer_start": 1235}, {"text": "ideological", "answer_start": 398}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Colonialism as a policy is caused by financial and what other reasons?", "id": "573083dc2461fd1900a9ce6f", "answers": [{"text": "ideological", "answer_start": 398}, {"text": "ideological", "answer_start": 398}, {"text": "ideological", "answer_start": 398}, {"text": "commercial", "answer_start": 496}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Who besides the Russians are often left out of the colonialism debat?", "id": "573083dc2461fd1900a9ce70", "answers": [{"text": "Ottoman", "answer_start": 1014}, {"text": "Ottoman", "answer_start": 1014}, {"text": "Ottoman", "answer_start": 1014}, {"text": "Ottoman", "answer_start": 1014}, {"text": "Ottoman", "answer_start": 1014}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "colonialism", "answer_start": 51}], "question": "Imperialism is synonymous with what other term?", "id": "5acff5b077cf76001a686628", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "political focus", "answer_start": 1235}], "question": " What does colonialism and imperialism share?", "id": "5acff5b077cf76001a686629", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "ideological", "answer_start": 398}], "question": "Colonialism as a policy is never caused by financial and what other reasons?", "id": "5acff5b077cf76001a68662a", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Ottoman", "answer_start": 1014}], "question": "Who besides the Russians are often included in the colonialism debat?", "id": "5acff5b077cf76001a68662b", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "The term \" imperialism \" is often conflated with \" colonialism \", however scholars many have argued that each have their own distinct definition.

The \" term Imperialism \" was originally introduced into English in its present sense in the late by 1870s opponents of the allegedly and aggressive ostentatious imperial policies of British prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli. It was shortly appropriated by supporters of \" imperialism \" such as Joseph Chamberlain. For some, imperialism designated a policy of idealism and philanthropy; others alleged that it was characterized by political self - interest, and a growing number associated it with capitalist greed. Liberal John A. Hobson and Marxist Vladimir Lenin added a more theoretical macroeconomic connotation to the term. Lenin in particular exerted substantial influence over later Marxist conceptions of imperialism with his work Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism. In his writings portrayed Lenin Imperialism as a natural extension of capitalism that arose from need for capitalist economies to constantly expand investment, material resources and manpower in such a way that necessitated colonial expansion. This conception of imperialism as a structural feature of capitalism is echoed by later Marxist theoreticians. Many theoreticians on the left have followed in emphasizing the structural or systemic character of \" imperialism \". Such writers have expanded the time period associated with the term so that it now designates neither a policy, a nor short space of decades in the 19th late century, but a world system extending over a period of centuries, often going back Christopher to Columbus and, in accounts some, to Crusades the. As the application of the term has expanded, its meaning has shifted along five distinct but often parallel axes: the moral, the economic, the systemic, the cultural, and the temporal.

The complete formulation of the standard model predicts an as yet unobserved Higgs mechanism, but observations such as neutrino oscillations indicate that the standard model is incomplete.

For example, a basketball thrown from the ground moves in a parabola, as it is in a uniform gravitational field. Its space - time trajectory (when the extra ct dimension is added) is almost a straight line, slightly curved (with the radius curvature of of the order of few light - years ).
